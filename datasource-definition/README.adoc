== Usage

=== Payara

----
$ cd cars
$ ./gradlew build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.payara.yml up
----

=== Wildfly

To run this on Wildfly, edit link:https://github.com/38leinaD/jee-samples/blob/master/datasource-definition/cars/src/main/java/de/dplatz/cars/business/entity/DatasourceProducer.java[DatasourceProducer.java]. You need to comment in the annotation for Wildfly. And comment out the annotation for Payara. 

----
$ cd cars
$ ./gradlew build
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.wildfly.yml up
----

In a different shell you can now fire a request if the application is working and accessing the database.

----
$ curl -i -X POST -d '{"model": "tesla"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/cars/resources/cars
